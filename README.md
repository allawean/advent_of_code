## Some thoughts
Since I use Python daily for the last five years, the first puzzle was way too easy. So I decided to do it in a more challenging way. In a high school, I had a programming semminar, where we learned C and C++. I knew I was veeery rusty in these, but was surprised how challenging it was for me. Of course, with pointers, nothing is easy, but the file handling was just too nasty.
